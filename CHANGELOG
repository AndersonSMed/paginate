Version 0.3.2 - 2008-01-31
--------------------------
Public release on PyPi

Version 0.4.0 - 2012-12-XXX
--------------------------
Paginate has prior been maintained as webhelpers.paginate in the _webhelpers_ packages.
This version is a standalone version that should be useful outside of the webhelpers'
context.

Changes:
- Python 3 compatibility.
- SQLAlchemyObject and SQLAlchemyQuery collections are not automatically detected any more.
  Instead you can use the respective Page class from the paginate_sqlalchemy module also
  available on PyPi.
- presliced_list parameter no longer supported
- 'page_nr' and 'current_page' had been deprecated already and are now removed. Please use 'page'
  instead.
- No automatic URL generation. You need to pass a 'url' argument to the Page.pager() method
  containing a $page placeholder where you want the page number to be put in
- The Page.pager() does not automatically add CSS classes any more. If you want the old
  behavior you need to pass these parameters explicitly:
  link_attr={'class':'pager_link'}
  curpage_attr={'class':'pager_curpage'}
  dotdot_attr={'class':'pager_dotdot'}
