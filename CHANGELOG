Version 0.3.2 - 2008-01-31
--------------------------
Public release on PyPi

Version 0.4.0 - 2012-12-XXX
--------------------------
Paginate has prior been maintained as webhelpers.paginate in the _webhelpers_ packages.
This version is a standalone version that should be useful outside of the webhelpers'
context.

Changes:
- Python 3 compatibility.
- SQLAlchemyObject and SQLAlchemyQuery collections are not automatically detected any more.
  Instead you can use the respective Page class from the paginate_sqlalchemy module also
  available on PyPi.
- presliced_list parameter no longer supported
- 'page_nr' and 'current_page' had been deprecated already and are now removed. Please use 'page'
  instead.
