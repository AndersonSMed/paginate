The paginate module contains extensive in-line documentation with examples.

This is a standalone module. Former versions were included in the WebHelpers
Python module as webhelpers.paginate and were tightly coupled with the
WebHelpers and the Pylons web framework. This version aims to be useful
independent of any web framework.
