What is pagination?
---------------------
This module helps dividing large lists of items into pages. The user 
is shown one page at a time and can navigate to other pages. Imagine you 
are offering a company phonebook and let the user search the entries. If 
the search result contains 23 entries but you may want to display no 
more than 10 entries at once. The first page contains entries 1-10, the 
second 11-20 and the third 21-23. See the documentation of the "Page" 
class for more information. 

How do I use this module?
---------------------------
The paginate module contains extensive in-line documentation with examples.

Concerning WebHelpers
-----------------------
This is a standalone module. Former versions were included in the WebHelpers
Python module as webhelpers.paginate and were tightly coupled with the
WebHelpers and the Pylons web framework. This version aims to be useful
independent of any web framework.

Subclassing Page()
------------------
This module supports pagination through list-like objects. To paginate though
other types of objects you can subclass the paginate.Page() class and override
these methods that otherwise are derived from the built-in *list* class:

__iter__
    Returns an iterable. In many cases it is just the object itself.
    
__len__
    Returns the total number of elements.
    
__getitem__
    Returns items for a given range. Does not need to support getting single items.
